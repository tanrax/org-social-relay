# Org Social Relay

## Introduction

Org Social Relay is a P2P system that acts as an intermediary between all [Org Social](https://github.com/tanrax/org-social) files. It scans the network, creating an index of users, mentions, replies, groups and threads. This allows you to:

- Receive mentions and replies.
- Have a more comprehensive notification system.
- Read or participate in threads.
- Perform searches (tags and full text).
- Participate in groups.

## Concepts

- **List nodes**: Index of public nodes. Simple list with all the URLs of the Nodes (`https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/tanrax/org-social/org-social-relay-list.txt`). It will be used by nodes to find other nodes and share information.
- **Node**: A server running Org Social Relay (this software). It scans the network and shares information with other nodes or clients.
- **Client**: An application that connects to a Node to get information. It can be Org Social or any other application that implements the Org Social Relay API.

## Installation

You need to have Docker and Docker Compose installed.

### 1. Create a `.env` file based on `envExample`

```bash
cp envExample .env
```

### 2. Edit variables as needed

```bash
nano .env
```

#### Important Environment Variables

- **`GROUPS`**: Comma-separated list of group names available in the relay (optional)
  - Example: `GROUPS=Emacs,Org Social,Elisp`
  - Group names can have spaces and capital letters
  - Slugs (for URLs) are generated automatically (lowercase, spaces become hyphens)
  - Leave empty if no groups are needed
  - Groups allow users to participate in topic-based discussions

### 3. Run with Docker Compose

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

## Make your Org Social Relay public

If you want your Relay to be used by other users, and also communicate with other public Relays to work together scanning the network and improving everyone's speed, you must make a Pull Request to this file:

https://github.com/tanrax/org-social/blob/main/org-social-relay-list.txt

Add your Relay URL (e.g. `https://my-relay.example.com`) in a new line.

## Endpoints for clients

### Important Note: URL Encoding

When passing URLs as query parameters (like `feed` or `post`), they **must be URL-encoded** to avoid conflicts with special characters like `#`, `?`, `&`, etc.

**Examples:**
- `https://example.com/social.org` ‚Üí `https%3A%2F%2Fexample.com%2Fsocial.org`
- `https://foo.org/social.org#2025-02-03T23:05:00+0100` ‚Üí `https%3A%2F%2Ffoo.org%2Fsocial.org%232025-02-03T23%3A05%3A00%2B0100`

You can use:
- Manual encoding: `curl "http://localhost:8080/endpoint/?param=encoded_url"`
- curl's automatic encoding: `curl -G "http://localhost:8080/endpoint/" --data-urlencode "param=unencoded_url"`

### Root

`/` - Basic information about the relay.

```sh
curl http://localhost:8080/
```

### Get notifications

`/notifications/?feed={url feed}` - Get all notifications (mentions, reactions, and replies) received by a given feed. Results are ordered from most recent to oldest.

```sh
# URL must be encoded when passed as query parameter
curl "http://localhost:8080/notifications/?feed=https%3A%2F%2Fexample.com%2Fsocial.org"

# Or use curl's --data-urlencode for automatic encoding:
curl -G "http://localhost:8080/notifications/" --data-urlencode "feed=https://example.com/social.org"
```

```json
{
    "type": "Success",
    "errors": [],
    "data": [
        {
            "type": "reaction",
            "post": "https://alice.org/social.org#2025-02-05T13:15:00+0100",

        },
        {
            "type": "mention",
            "post": "https://charlie.org/social.org#2025-02-05T11:20:00+0100"
        },
        {
            "type": "reaction",
            "post": "https://diana.org/social.org#2025-02-04T15:45:00+0100",
            "emoji": "üöÄ",
            "parent": "https://example.com/social.org#2025-02-04T10:00:00+0100"
        }
    ],
    "meta": {
        "feed": "https://example.com/social.org",
        "total": 4,
        "by_type": {
            "mentions": 1,
            "reactions": 2,
            "replies": 1
        },
        "version": "123"
    },
    "_links": {
        "self": {"href": "/notifications/?feed=https%3A%2F%2Fexample.com%2Fsocial.org", "method": "GET"},
        "mentions": {"href": "/mentions/?feed=https%3A%2F%2Fexample.com%2Fsocial.org", "method": "GET"},
        "reactions": {"href": "/reactions/?feed=https%3A%2F%2Fexample.com%2Fsocial.org", "method": "GET"},
        "replies-to": {"href": "/replies-to/?feed=https%3A%2F%2Fexample.com%2Fsocial.org", "method": "GET"}
    }
}
```

Each notification includes:
- `type`: The notification type (`"mention"`, `"reaction"`, or `"reply"`)
- `post`: The notification post URL (format: `{author_feed}#{timestamp}`)
- `emoji`: (Only for reactions) The reaction emoji
- `parent`: (Only for reactions and replies) The post URL that received the notification

**Mentions** only have `type` and `post` because you are the one being mentioned in someone else's post.

**Reactions and replies** have `parent` to indicate which of your posts received the reaction/reply.

To extract the author's feed from the `post` field, simply take the part before the `#` character. For example, from `https://alice.org/social.org#2025-02-05T13:15:00+0100`, the author is `https://alice.org/social.org`.

The `version` in the `meta` field is a unique identifier for the current state of all notifications. You can use it to check if there are new notifications since your last request.

The `by_type` breakdown in `meta` allows you to show notification counts per type in your UI.

**Optional parameters:**
- `type`: Filter by notification type (`mention`, `reaction`, `reply`)
  - Example: `/notifications/?feed={feed}&type=reaction`

### Get mentions

`/mentions/?feed={url feed}` - Get mentions for a given feed. Results are ordered from most recent to oldest.

```sh
# URL must be encoded when passed as query parameter
curl "http://localhost:8080/mentions/?feed=https%3A%2F%2Fexample.com%2Fsocial.org"

# Or use curl's --data-urlencode for automatic encoding:
curl -G "http://localhost:8080/mentions/" --data-urlencode "feed=https://example.com/social.org"
```

```json
{
    "type": "Success",
    "errors": [],
    "data": [
        "https://foo.org/social.org#2025-02-03T23:05:00+0100",
        "https://bar.org/social.org#2025-02-04T10:15:00+0100",
        "https://baz.org/social.org#2025-02-05T08:30:00+0100"
    ],
    "meta": {
        "feed": "https://example.com/social.org",
        "total": 3,
        "version": "123"
    },
    "_links": {
        "self": {"href": "/mentions/?feed=https%3A%2F%2Fexample.com%2Fsocial.org", "method": "GET"}
    }
}
```

The `version` in the `meta` field is a unique identifier for the current state of mentions for the given feed. You can use it to check if there are new mentions since your last request.

### Get reactions

`/reactions/?feed={url feed}` - Get all reactions received by posts from a given feed. A reaction is a special post with a `:MOOD:` property and `:REPLY_TO:` pointing to the reacted post. Results are ordered from most recent to oldest.

```sh
# URL must be encoded when passed as query parameter
curl "http://localhost:8080/reactions/?feed=https%3A%2F%2Fexample.com%2Fsocial.org"

# Or use curl's --data-urlencode for automatic encoding:
curl -G "http://localhost:8080/reactions/" --data-urlencode "feed=https://example.com/social.org"
```

```json
{
    "type": "Success",
    "errors": [],
    "data": [
        {
            "post": "https://alice.org/social.org#2025-02-05T13:15:00+0100",
            "emoji": "‚ù§",
            "parent": "https://example.com/social.org#2025-02-05T12:00:00+0100"
        },
        {
            "post": "https://bob.org/social.org#2025-02-05T14:30:00+0100",
            "emoji": "üöÄ",
            "parent": "https://example.com/social.org#2025-02-05T12:00:00+0100"
        },
        {
            "post": "https://charlie.org/social.org#2025-02-04T11:20:00+0100",
            "emoji": "üëç",
            "parent": "https://example.com/social.org#2025-02-04T10:00:00+0100"
        }
    ],
    "meta": {
        "feed": "https://example.com/social.org",
        "total": 3,
        "version": "123"
    },
    "_links": {
        "self": {"href": "/reactions/?feed=https%3A%2F%2Fexample.com%2Fsocial.org", "method": "GET"}
    }
}
```

The response includes:
- `post`: The reaction post URL (format: `{author_feed}#{timestamp}`)
- `emoji`: The reaction emoji (from `:MOOD:` property)
- `parent`: The post URL that received the reaction

To extract the author's feed from the `post` field, simply take the part before the `#` character. For example, from `https://alice.org/social.org#2025-02-05T13:15:00+0100`, the author is `https://alice.org/social.org`.

The `version` in the `meta` field is a unique identifier for the current state of reactions for the given feed. You can use it to check if there are new reactions since your last request.

**Note:** According to Org Social specification, reactions are posts with:
- `:REPLY_TO:` property pointing to the reacted post
- `:MOOD:` property containing the emoji
- Empty or minimal content

### Get replies to feed

`/replies-to/?feed={url feed}` - Get all replies received by posts from a given feed. A reply is a post with a `:REPLY_TO:` property pointing to one of your posts (but without a `:MOOD:` or `:POLL_OPTION:` property, which would make it a reaction or poll vote instead). Results are ordered from most recent to oldest.

```sh
# URL must be encoded when passed as query parameter
curl "http://localhost:8080/replies-to/?feed=https%3A%2F%2Fexample.com%2Fsocial.org"

# Or use curl's --data-urlencode for automatic encoding:
curl -G "http://localhost:8080/replies-to/" --data-urlencode "feed=https://example.com/social.org"
```

```json
{
    "type": "Success",
    "errors": [],
    "data": [
        {
            "post": "https://alice.org/social.org#2025-02-05T13:15:00+0100",
            "parent": "https://example.com/social.org#2025-02-05T12:00:00+0100"
        },
        {
            "post": "https://bob.org/social.org#2025-02-05T14:30:00+0100",
            "parent": "https://example.com/social.org#2025-02-05T12:00:00+0100"
        },
        {
            "post": "https://charlie.org/social.org#2025-02-04T11:20:00+0100",
            "parent": "https://example.com/social.org#2025-02-04T10:00:00+0100"
        }
    ],
    "meta": {
        "feed": "https://example.com/social.org",
        "total": 3,
        "version": "123"
    },
    "_links": {
        "self": {"href": "/replies-to/?feed=https%3A%2F%2Fexample.com%2Fsocial.org", "method": "GET"}
    }
}
```

The response includes:
- `post`: The reply post URL (format: `{author_feed}#{timestamp}`)
- `parent`: The post URL that received the reply

To extract the author's feed from the `post` field, simply take the part before the `#` character. For example, from `https://alice.org/social.org#2025-02-05T13:15:00+0100`, the author is `https://alice.org/social.org`.

The `version` in the `meta` field is a unique identifier for the current state of replies for the given feed. You can use it to check if there are new replies since your last request.

**Note:** This endpoint shows direct replies to your posts. To see the full conversation thread of a specific post, use the `/replies/?post={post_url}` endpoint instead.

### Get replies/threads

`/replies/?post={url post}` - Get replies for a given post. This will return a tree structure with all the replies to posts in the given feed. If you want to see the entire tree, you must use the meta `parent` as a  `post`.

```sh
# URL must be encoded when passed as query parameter
curl "http://localhost:8080/replies/?post=https%3A%2F%2Ffoo.org%2Fsocial.org%232025-02-03T23%3A05%3A00%2B0100"

# Or use curl's --data-urlencode for automatic encoding:
curl -G "http://localhost:8080/replies/" --data-urlencode "post=https://foo.org/social.org#2025-02-03T23:05:00+0100"
```

```json

## Groups Configuration

Org Social Relay supports organizing posts into topic-based groups. Users can join groups to participate in focused discussions.

### Configuring Groups

To configure groups in your relay, set the `GROUPS` environment variable with a comma-separated list of group names:

```bash
# In your .env file
GROUPS=Emacs,Org Social,Elisp,Programming,Tech
```

### Groups Configuration Examples

**No groups (default):**
```bash
GROUPS=
# or simply omit the GROUPS variable
```

**Single group:**
```bash
GROUPS=Emacs
```

**Multiple groups:**
```bash
GROUPS=Emacs,Org Social,Elisp
```

### Using Groups

Once configured, users can:
1. View group-specific message threads
2. Discover other group members
3. Post messages to specific groups

The groups endpoints will only be available when groups are configured via the `GROUPS` environment variable.

## Technical information

You can find the public Relay list in `https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/tanrax/org-social/org-social-relay-list.txt`.

### Crons

#### Scan feeds

**Every minute**, Relay will scan all registered feeds for new posts, mentions, replies, polls, and profile updates. After each scan, the cache is automatically cleared to ensure all endpoints return fresh data.

During the scan, users continue to see cached data (complete and consistent, even if slightly outdated). Once the scan completes and cache is cleared, the next request will fetch fresh data from the database.

#### Scan other nodes

Every 3 hours, Relay will search for new users on other nodes.

#### Discover new feeds

Every day at midnight, Relay analyzes the feeds of all registered users to discover new feeds they follow.
