# Org Social Relay

## Introduction

Org Social Relay is a P2P system that acts as an intermediary between all [Org Social](https://github.com/tanrax/org-social) files. It scans the network, creating an index of users, mentions, replies, groups and threads. This allows you to:

- Receive mentions and replies.
- Have a more comprehensive notification system.
- Read or participate in threads.
- Perform searches (tags and full text).
- Participate in groups.

## Installation

You need to have Docker and Docker Compose installed.

### 1. Create a `.env` file based on `envExample`

```bash
cp envExample .env
```

### 2. Edit variables as needed

```bash
nano .env
```

#### Important Environment Variables

- **`GROUPS`**: Comma-separated list of groups available in the relay (optional)
  - Example: `GROUPS=emacs,org-social,elisp`
  - Leave empty if no groups are needed
  - Groups allow users to participate in topic-based discussions

### 3. Run with Docker Compose

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

## Make your Org Social Relay public

If you want your Relay to be used by other users, and also communicate with other public Relays to work together scanning the network and improving everyone's speed, you must make a Pull Request to this file:

https://github.com/tanrax/org-social/blob/main/org-social-relay-list.txt

Add your Relay URL (e.g. `https://my-relay.example.com`) in a new line.

## Endpoints for clients

### Important Note: URL Encoding

When passing URLs as query parameters (like `feed` or `post`), they **must be URL-encoded** to avoid conflicts with special characters like `#`, `?`, `&`, etc.

**Examples:**
- `https://example.com/social.org` → `https%3A%2F%2Fexample.com%2Fsocial.org`
- `https://foo.org/social.org#2025-02-03T23:05:00+0100` → `https%3A%2F%2Ffoo.org%2Fsocial.org%232025-02-03T23%3A05%3A00%2B0100`

You can use:
- Manual encoding: `curl "http://localhost:8080/endpoint/?param=encoded_url"`
- curl's automatic encoding: `curl -G "http://localhost:8080/endpoint/" --data-urlencode "param=unencoded_url"`

### Root

`/` - Basic information about the relay.

```sh
curl http://localhost:8080/
```

```json
{
    "_links": [
        {"rel": "self", "href": "/", "method": "GET"},
        {"rel": "list-feeds", "href": "/feeds/", "method": "GET"},
        {"rel": "add-feed", "href": "/feeds/", "method": "POST"},
        {"rel": "get-mentions", "href": "/mentions/?feed={url feed}", "method": "GET"},
        {"rel": "get-replies", "href": "/replies/?post={url post}", "method": "GET"},
        {"rel": "search", "href": "/search/?q={query}", "method": "GET"},
        {"rel": "list-groups", "href": "/groups/", "method": "GET"},
        {"rel": "get-group-messages", "href": "/groups/{group id}/", "method": "GET"},
        {"rel": "register-group-member", "href": "/groups/{group id}/members/?feed={url feed}", "method": "POST"},
        {"rel": "list-polls", "href": "/polls/", "method": "GET"},
        {"rel": "get-poll-votes", "href": "/polls/votes/?post={url post}", "method": "GET"}
    ]
}
```

### List feeds

`/feeds/` - List all registered feeds.

```sh
curl http://localhost:8080/feeds/
```

```json
{
    "type": "Success",
    "errors": [],
    "data": [
        "https://example.com/social.org",
        "https://another-example.com/social.org"
    ]
}
```

### Add feed

`/feeds/` - Add a new feed to be scanned.

```sh
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/feeds/ -d '{"feed": "https://example.com/path/to/your/file.org"}' -H "Content-Type: application/json"
```

```json
{
    "type": "Success",
    "errors": [],
    "data": {
        "feed": "https://example.com/path/to/your/file.org"
    }
}
```


### Get mentions

`/mentions/?feed={url feed}` - Get mentions for a given feed. Results are ordered from most recent to oldest.

```sh
# URL must be encoded when passed as query parameter
curl "http://localhost:8080/mentions/?feed=https%3A%2F%2Fexample.com%2Fsocial.org"

# Or use curl's --data-urlencode for automatic encoding:
curl -G "http://localhost:8080/mentions/" --data-urlencode "feed=https://example.com/social.org"
```

```json
{
    "type": "Success",
    "errors": [],
    "data": [
        "https://foo.org/social.org#2025-02-03T23:05:00+0100",
        "https://bar.org/social.org#2025-02-04T10:15:00+0100",
        "https://baz.org/social.org#2025-02-05T08:30:00+0100"
    ],
    "meta": {
        "feed": "https://example.com/social.org",
        "total": 3,
        "version": "123"
    }
}
```

The `version` in the `meta` field is a unique identifier for the current state of mentions for the given feed. You can use it to check if there are new mentions since your last request.

### Get replies/threads

`/replies/?post={url post}` - Get replies for a given post. This will return a tree structure with all the replies to posts in the given feed. If you want to see the entire tree, you must use the meta `parent` as a  `post`.

```sh
# URL must be encoded when passed as query parameter
curl "http://localhost:8080/replies/?post=https%3A%2F%2Ffoo.org%2Fsocial.org%232025-02-03T23%3A05%3A00%2B0100"

# Or use curl's --data-urlencode for automatic encoding:
curl -G "http://localhost:8080/replies/" --data-urlencode "post=https://foo.org/social.org#2025-02-03T23:05:00+0100"
```

```json
{
    "type": "Success",
    "errors": [],
    "data": [
        {
            "post": "https://bar.org/social.org#2025-02-02T14:30:00+0100",
            "children": [
                {
                    "post": "https://baz.org/social.org#2025-02-03T09:45:00+0100",
                    "children": []
                },
                {
                    "post": "https://qux.org/social.org#2025-02-04T16:20:00+0100",
                    "children": [
                        {
                            "post": "https://quux.org/social.org#2025-02-05T11:10:00+0100",
                            "children": []
                        }
                    ]
                }

            ]
        },
        {
            "post": "https://corge.org/social.org#2025-02-03T18:00:00+0100",
            "children": []
        }
    ],
    "meta": {
        "parent": "https://moo.org/social.org#2025-02-03T23:05:00+0100",
        "version": "123"
    }
}
```

The `version` in the `meta` field is a unique identifier for the current state of replies for the given post. You can use it to check if there are new replies since your last request.

### Search

            "previous": null
        }

```

The `version` in the `meta` field is a unique identifier for the current state of votes for the given poll. You can use it to check if there are new votes since your last request.

## Groups Configuration

Org Social Relay supports organizing posts into topic-based groups. Users can join groups to participate in focused discussions.

### Configuring Groups

To configure groups in your relay, set the `GROUPS` environment variable with a comma-separated list of group names:

```bash
# In your .env file
GROUPS=emacs,org-social,elisp,programming,tech
```

### Groups Configuration Examples

**No groups (default):**
```bash
GROUPS=
# or simply omit the GROUPS variable
```

**Single group:**
```bash
GROUPS=emacs
```

**Multiple groups:**
```bash
GROUPS=emacs,org-social,elisp
```

### Groups Naming Guidelines

- Use lowercase letters, numbers, and hyphens
- Keep names descriptive but concise
- Examples: `emacs`, `org-social`, `web-dev`, `machine-learning`

### Using Groups

Once configured, users can:
1. Join groups by registering their feeds as group members
2. Post messages to specific groups
3. View group-specific message threads
4. Discover other group members

The groups endpoints will only be available when groups are configured via the `GROUPS` environment variable.

## Technical information

You can find the public Relay list in `https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/tanrax/org-social/org-social-relay-list.txt`.

### Crons

#### Scan feeds

Every 10 minutes, Relay will scan all registered feeds for new posts.

#### Scan other nodes

Every hour, Relay will search for new users on other nodes.

#### Discover new feeds

Every day, Relay analyzes the feeds of all registered users to discover new feeds they follow.
